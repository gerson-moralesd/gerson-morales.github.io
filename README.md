### SIMIO WAREHOUSE: Fall 2023 Simio Case Study (_Fall 2023_)
This project focuses on improving the operations of a warehouse that supports an e-commerce platform selling advanced video cards used in applications like AI and cryptocurrency mining. We used Simio simulations to figure out how many workers are needed and to create efficient inventory policies, aiming to boost efficiency, reduce costs, and keep customers happy.

First, we analyzed a year’s worth of order data, then modeled the warehouse in Simio to test different management scenarios. The main tasks included handling bulk shipments of three types of video cards, testing and packaging them, and managing automated machines that sometimes fail and slow down the process.

We determined the best points to reorder stock and calculated optimal inventory levels for both unpackaged and packaged cards. Our simulation showed that having three workers per shift (totaling nine across three shifts) kept operations running smoothly without delays, meeting customer demand efficiently.

By fine-tuning our inventory policies and using the insights from the simulation, we were able to optimize the warehouse's performance, selling nearly 2 million cards monthly and maintaining reasonable costs. This project highlights the value of simulation tools like Simio in making informed decisions and improving warehouse management.

### Optimizing Distribution Networks for OptiCoffee (_Summer 2023_)
OptiCoffee aims to expand its operations in Bogotá and needs to select the best warehouses for storing and transporting coffee. The goal is to ensure a profitable expansion that can meet customer demand while maximizing warehouse capacity.

To tackle this, we formulated a mathematical model to design the optimal logistics distribution network for OptiCoffee. We optimized cost-efficient coffee distribution across three national networks, considering cost and distance constraints. Our analysis included developing a Python simulation model to evaluate and refine the proposed network design.

We analyzed two scenarios: one with a Triangular distribution and another using the mode scenario. We found that estimating demand with the expected value kept costs low but also lowered the probability of meeting demand. Conversely, using the mode (the most frequently requested value) increased costs but significantly improved the likelihood of meeting demand.

This analysis helps OptiCoffee make informed decisions about warehouse selection, balancing cost with the ability to meet customer needs effectively.
